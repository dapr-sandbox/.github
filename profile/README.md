# Welcome to the Dapr-Sandbox org ðŸ‘‹

The Dapr-Sandbox org is where projects first start out being developed before moving to Dapr org as they mature. 
This is modelled on the CNCF [Project Maturity Levels](https://www.cncf.io/projects/) and the [CNCF Sandbox Graduation Criteria](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/sandbox.md).

Projects in this repo are not expected to be used in production scenarios.

It is also possible for projects that are no longer being maintained in the Dapr org repo to be moved to the Dapr-Sandbox repo to indicate 
that these have returned to a experimental state.

## Admission to dapr-sandbox
